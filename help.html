			<h1>Need help putting your ideas together?</h1>

			<p>
				Let's be honest &mdash; not everyone is well-equipped enough to have an idea and 
				then realize it. Sometimes you need a <i>bit</i> of assistance getting things done 
				(or started!) and that's why I'm here. But you may still be fuzzy on the details needed 
				to get the process going. If so, here are some tips to help you out.
			</p>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>
					As with most things in life, jumping right into a project is not the best idea.
					Not to throw shade at Nike, but there's no telling how much time, effort, and brain power 
					you can end up wasting if you &ldquo;just do it&rdquo; &mdash; you need a game plan. 
					<img class="left" src="assets/media/todo.jpg" alt="Photo of a To Do List">
					So, your first step 
					in any new design project is to plan your planning. <br><br>

					No. Really! Try to identify <i>what</i> you want to acccomplish and why &mdash; like reaching a 
					different demographic, showcasing your skills, creating a digital space for your 
					loved ones &mdash; and the <i>how</i> will come a bit easier. If you want a place where employers
					can find your work, try a portfolio! If you want to share your passions with the world
					on a frequent basis, blogging might be for you. Selling items? An online store may be the 
					perfect fit. <br><br>

					By identifying the <b>purpose</b> of your new project, you are better equipped to tackling the 
					tasks that come with it. For sales, that will be taking product images and setting price points 
					&mdash; for blogging, it's determining discussion topics, identifying post frequencies, and setting 
					aside time for research. From here, you can decide the scope of your project and estimate the time you
					may need to get things done. If you're working with someone to help bring your idea to life, 
					identifying your purpose and scope will aid them tremendously with getting as close to your ideal
					content as possible in a shorter amount of time!
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Structure</h2>
				<p>
					Great! You've figured out what you'd like to create, now the focus should be how
					to bring that to fruition. Do you want to go with a standard top-down approach or 
					a left-to-right orientation? Would you prefer the content to be laid out like a 
					collage or a grid? When it comes to the structure of your content, 
					the sky is pretty much the limit. But because your ideas may be just as endless, it 
					helps to try narrowing things down. <br><br>

					<img class="right" src="assets/media/layout.jpg" alt="Photo of of Wireframe"> 					
					
					First, identify the content theme you want for a specific page, like how-to videos, 
					professional photos, products, or blog posts. Then, choose how you would like to format 
					those items. To make things easier, you may want to try drawing how you would like 
					those elements laid out on your page. Doing this will help you conceptualize how you want 
					the page to look and feel. Finally, repeat the first two steps for any subsequent pages.
				</p>
				
				<div class="note">
					<span>NOTE:</span>
					<p>
						Keep in mind that your web pages don't have to look the same, but you also 
						don't want to make it hard for your users to navigate the site from page to page. So, 
						simplify your navigation and get creative with everything else!
					</p>

				<h2>Brand Guide</h2>
				<p>
					By now you've got most of your your brain child down to a science, but something is still missing 
					&mdash; color! Okay, so not <i>just</i> the colors: there's also the copy, font, 
					mood, and branding. All of this can be placed in a neat little package called a &ldquo;Brand 
					Guide&rdquo; which is essentially a document that specifies how your brand should 
					present itself. You can add examples, make the whole thing look the way you want your brand 
					to feel, or even put do's and dont's! Yes, building a brand guide seems like a lot &mdash; and 
					sometimes, it can be &mdash; but it doesn't have to be. We'll simplify the process by covering 
					its main components: aesthetic, memorability, and mood.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Aesthetic</h3>
				<p>
					The first thing most people notice when they look at a flyer, business card, or webpage is
					the content's overall look &mdash; and that's valid! Appearance is an introduction to your brand, 
					so you want your audience to like what they see. And if aesthetics are a first impression, why 
					not make it an awesome one? To do so, you'll want to focus on the two major components to your 
					brand's aesthetic: your color palette and your typography.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Color Palette</h4>
				<p>
					When you think of color palette, you probably envision an artist sitting at their easel waiting
					to create a masterpiece or art class from grade school. And that's perfect, because that's what 
					you <i>should</i> be thinking of! <br><br>
					
					<img class="left" src="assets/media/palette.jpg" alt="Photo of a Monochromatic Palette">
					
					Now, I won't tell you to focus heavily on color theory (although, 
					seriously &mdash; <u>do</u> incorporate color theory) but, I <i>will</i> tell you to pick at minimum 
					two or three colors (excluding black and white, if possible) that you want to represent 
					your brand. So, yes &mdash; color theory will <b>absolutely</b> play a role here whether you 
					go for primary, complementary, or monochromatic colors, but the focus should mostly be on 
					one premise, &ldquo;do these colors catch the eye and do they embody my brand?&rdquo;
					
					<div class="note">
						<span>NOTE:</span>
						<p>
							Colors have their meanings and moods that they carry with them as standalones, which can 
							be accentuated or redefined when combined with others &mdash; do remember that while 
							picking your palette!
						</p>
					</div>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Typography</h4>
				<p>
					Now we're getting to the good stuff &mdash; fonts! I won't bore you too much with the 
					specifics, but essentially your typography will be the font family and size, letter spacing 
					and line height, text arrangement, and a few other factors that go into branding. <br><br>
					
					<img class="right" src="assets/media/neon_sign.jpg" alt="Photo of a Neon Sign Reading 'Style!'">
					
					It may seem like a small matter, but typography (done properly) can be the one thing people 
					remember most about your brand. Done incorrectly, people will still remember you, but for all 
					the wrong reasons: a simple image search for &ldquo;letter spacing fails&rdquo; will explain 
					why &hellip; <br><br>
					
					No matter what you do, the font or fonts you select should be something that adds value to your 
					brand as you will be reusing it on all your media including business cards, flyers, and websites. 
					So be sure to pay extra attention to the sizing, because that will change between print and digital 
					mediums.
					
					<div class="tip">
						<span>TIP:</span>
						<p>
							When choosing fonts, there are five major font types: serif, san-serif, script, 
							handwriting, and monospace. Consider how each will look with your signs and logos 
							before committing <i>just</i> to be on the safe side.
						</p>
					</div>						 
				</p>

				<h3>Memorability</h3>
				<p>
					Fall Out Boy may have had something when they sang, &ldquo;remember me for centuries&rdquo; 
					because that is <i>exactly</i> what you want to do when creating your brand. You want people to 
					remember what your brand is and what you do so that you can grow your customer base. While there are 
					quite a few things you can do with your branding to capture your audience&rsquo;s attention and linger 
					in their memories, we'll only focus on two components: logos and names.
				</p>
		
				<h4>Logo</h4>
				<p>
					Logos are pretty prevalent in society to the point where we almost associate them 
					to the company faster than its own name. Think Nike, Apple, Puma, Google, Starbucks, and 
					Target	&mdash; they all have iconic logos, all of which I'm sure popped into your head 
					as you were reading this list. The reason why? Logos are entities unto themselves, so you 
					can easily set a logo where you would normally place the brand name if the brand has 
					been established well enough (or if, like Levi's, your name is actually <i>part</i> of 
					the logo). <br><br>
					
					<img class="left" src="assets/media/route_66.jpg" alt="Photo of a Neon Route 66 Sign">
					
					Logos are incorporated in the "first impression" described above, because they function like 
					your brand's "face". So, when you are coming up with a logo, you really want to focus on how 
					your audience will see you and your brand. Choose how you would like to introduce yourself to the 
					world: either take from the name or choose something symbolic.
					
					<div class="tip">
						<span>TIP:</span>
						<p>
							Come up with more than one logo because depending on the medium and scaling, your original 
							idea may not be as visible as you'd like. Play around with your logo and try resizing it. If certain elements in your logo become hard to distinguish (like a icon in a browser tab), 
							then you may need to come up with a simpler logo for that size specifically.
						</p>
					</div>
				</p>
	
				<h4>Name</h4>
				<p>
					<img class="right" src="assets/media/identity.jpg" alt="Photo of Three Magnetic Words Reading, 'who are you'">
					Speaking of names, if your logo is your face, then your name is your identity. This is your 
					official &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; to the world, so pick it carefully. Consider whether you want the
					brand name to reflect what you do specifically like uBreakiFix, to be someone's name like Abercrombie
					&amp; Fitch, or to be more abstract yet memorable like BlackBerry. <br><br>
					
					Just keep in mind that you may not want to make your name too long or your audience may truncate it 
					for you!
				</p>

				<h3>Mood</h3>
				<p>
					The mood of your brand is how you interact with your audience &mdash; it's your brand's "personality". 
					And honestly, it's the best tie-in for all your brand's other elements. The images, the name, the 
					logos, the typography, the colors &mdash; all of these are a part of the mood you set for your brand. But there is one thing that hasn't been covered just yet: your voice.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Voice</h4>
				<p>
					<img class="left" src="assets/media/mic.jpg" alt="Photo of a Mic and Pop Filter">					Your brand's voice is really the copy you use to communicate to your audience. Sales messages, 
					text in an email, quips on a flyer &mdash; these are all your voice. The goal is to keep it consistent
					across all mediums, so you should choose how you want to come across. Is your brand encouraging, 
					friendly, warm, empowering? Whatever you choose, it should permeate every aspect of your business. 
					In fact, your voice can impact your aesthetics! Because the brand guide is a homogenous collection 
					every element is impacted by another and what results is the brand itself. So, set the mood right and 
					let your voice be heard (literally)!
				</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				And that's it! Granted, these steps are a bit oversimplified, but the goal here is to give you &mdash; 
				the one who will be most affected by the end result &mdash; a starting point so you can get to your finished
				product a little faster. If coming up with any part of the design or brand guide becomes too difficult, that's okay! 
				You can always ask a friend, family member, or trusted colleague for their opinion to help you brainstorm and 
				(with their permission, of course) try to incorporate it into your design/branding. Or you could just, you know, 
				hire someone like me to help you round out the rough edges. &hearts;
