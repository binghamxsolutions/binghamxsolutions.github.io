			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				So this this the part where you'll want to add some useful information
				about what you've got going on. This can be an origin story, a brief service
				overview, or a more of a personal insight into yourself and/or business. Whatever 
				you choose to go with, be sure to make it apparent to your audience what it is 
				that you do and why they should choose you.

					<h2>People, Profit, Planet</h2>
					<p>
						This is optional of course, but sometimes it's good to give the people a little more
						information. You've no doubt explained what you do and why you're the best choice, but
						for those still teetering on the edge, sub-sections like this one can give them an
						extra boost. Tell them something like how you give back to the community, or gave kids 
						a scholarship because of an aid program you head, or provided relief service to a country 
						after a natural disaster. People like seeing stories of how businesses put the human back
						in humanity, after all.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Initiatives</h2>
					<p>
						You may want to do something like communicating projects. Maybe you have a goal 
						you are in the process of achieving (or have already achieved). Perhaps there's a unique
						way of running your company. There may be special talent that you feel would not only add
						value to your work process, but would make people want to hire you. Whatever you feel people
						ought to know about you, your brand, and your process - add it to this page!
